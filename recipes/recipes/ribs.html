  <h1>St. Louis Ribs</h1>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    St. Louis Ribs are distinguished by their particular cut, which is flatter
    and more uniform than other rib styles, making them ideal for grilling and
    smoking. This cut, trimmed from the spare rib, results in a meatier and
    slightly fattier portion, providing a succulent, flavorful experience. When
    properly cooked, St. Louis Ribs offer a beautiful balance of meat and fat,
    with a crispy exterior bark and tender, moist interior that falls off the
    bone.
  </p>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Begin by removing the membrane from the back of the ribs for better flavor
      absorption and tenderness. Use a knife to gently lift the membrane and
      paper towels for a firm grip to pull it away completely.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prepare a dry rub by combining brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, onion
      powder, salt, pepper, and a touch of cayenne for heat. Coat the ribs
      evenly on both sides with the rub, pressing it into the meat to adhere.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat your smoker to 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius). Use a
      fruit wood like apple or cherry for a sweet, mild smoke, or hickory for a
      stronger flavor.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the ribs in the smoker, meat side up, and smoke for about 3 to 4
      hours. Avoid opening the smoker frequently to maintain a consistent
      temperature.
    </li>
    <li>
      After the initial smoking phase, wrap the ribs in aluminum foil with a
      splash of apple cider vinegar or your choice of liquid to keep them moist.
      Return them to the smoker for another 2 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove the foil and apply a layer of barbecue sauce to the ribs. Return
      them to the smoker for an additional hour, unwrapped, to allow the sauce
      to caramelize and the ribs to achieve a perfect glaze.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the ribs reach an internal temperature of 190 to 200 degrees
      Fahrenheit (88 to 93 degrees Celsius), remove them from the smoker. Let
      them rest for about 10 minutes before slicing between the bones.
    </li>
    <li>
      Serve the ribs with additional barbecue sauce on the side and enjoy the
      deep, smoky flavors and tender meat.
    </li>
