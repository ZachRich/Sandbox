  <h1>Pulled Pork</h1>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Smoked pulled pork is a classic barbecue favorite, renowned for its
    succulent, fall-apart tenderness achieved through low and slow cooking. A
    seasoned pork shoulder, or Boston butt, is smoked over hardwood like hickory
    or applewood, absorbing deep, smoky flavors over many hours. The magic
    happens at a steady 225 degrees Fahrenheit, transforming the meat into a
    tender delight that effortlessly shreds apart. This mouthwatering dish is
    often served with a tangy barbecue sauce, embodying the true essence of
    American barbecue.
  </p>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Choose a pork shoulder (also known as Boston butt) weighing between 5 to 7
      pounds. Trim excess fat to about 1/4-inch thickness to ensure even cooking
      and good flavor penetration.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prepare your dry rub by mixing together brown sugar, paprika, salt, ground
      black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and a touch of cayenne pepper
      for heat. Adjust the quantities based on your taste preference.
    </li>
    <li>
      Generously apply the dry rub all over the pork shoulder, ensuring it is
      fully coated. For best results, let the pork sit with the rub on it in the
      refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or overnight to allow the flavors to
      penetrate deeply.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat your smoker to 225 degrees Fahrenheit. Use a hardwood like
      hickory, apple, or oak for smoking as they impart a nice flavor to the
      meat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the pork shoulder in the smoker, fat side up, to allow the fat to
      render and baste the meat during the cooking process. Insert a meat
      thermometer into the thickest part of the shoulder but not touching the
      bone.
    </li>
    <li>
      Smoke the pork shoulder at 225 degrees Fahrenheit until the internal
      temperature reaches 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit. This can take anywhere
      from 1.5 to 2 hours per pound of meat, so plan accordingly.
    </li>
    <li>
      During the smoking process, you can spritz the pork shoulder with apple
      cider vinegar or apple juice every hour to keep it moist. This step is
      optional but adds flavor and helps with the crust formation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the pork reaches the desired internal temperature, remove it from the
      smoker and wrap it in aluminum foil. Let it rest for at least 1 hour. This
      step is crucial as it allows the juices to redistribute throughout the
      meat, making it more tender and flavorful.
    </li>
    <li>
      After resting, pull the pork apart using two forks or your hands (if it's
      not too hot). The meat should be tender enough to shred easily.
    </li>
    <li>
      Serve the pulled pork on its own or with your favorite barbecue sauce and
      sides like coleslaw, baked beans, or cornbread.
    </li>
  </ol>
