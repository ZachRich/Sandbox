  <h1>Smoked Brisket</h1>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Smoked brisket is the epitome of Texas barbecue, celebrated for its robust
    flavor and melt-in-your-mouth texture. The brisket is seasoned with a simple
    but powerful rub, then smoked over oak or mesquite at 225 degrees Fahrenheit
    until it achieves a perfect balance of tenderness and crust. This process,
    often extending over 12 to 16 hours, allows the meat's flavors to deepen and
    develop, resulting in a sliceable delicacy that's juicy and flavorful.
    Smoked brisket stands as a testament to the art of patience in barbecue,
    offering a rewarding feast for any meat lover.
  </p>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Select a whole packer brisket which includes both the flat and point cuts,
      weighing between 10 to 14 pounds. Trim the fat cap to about 1/4-inch
      thickness to ensure even cooking and flavor absorption.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prepare your brisket rub by combining coarse black pepper, sea salt,
      garlic powder, onion powder, and a little smoked paprika for added flavor.
      The basic ratio of salt to pepper can be 1:1, adjusted to taste.
    </li>
    <li>
      Apply the rub generously on all sides of the brisket. For best flavor
      infusion, wrap the seasoned brisket in plastic wrap and refrigerate
      overnight, or for at least a few hours before smoking.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat your smoker to 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius). Use a
      hardwood such as oak, hickory, or mesquite for a traditional Texas-style
      brisket.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the brisket in the smoker, fat side up, to allow the fat to render
      and naturally baste the meat during the long smoking process. Insert a
      meat thermometer into the thickest part of the brisket, avoiding the fat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Smoke the brisket at 225 degrees Fahrenheit until the internal temperature
      reaches about 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius). At this point,
      you may choose to wrap the brisket in butcher paper or aluminum foil to
      retain moisture and expedite the cooking process.
    </li>
    <li>
      Continue smoking the wrapped brisket until the internal temperature
      reaches between 200 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit (93 to 96 degrees Celsius).
      This could take anywhere from 12 to 16 hours total, depending on the size
      and thickness of your brisket.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the brisket reaches the desired internal temperature, remove it from
      the smoker and let it rest while still wrapped for at least 1 hour. This
      resting period allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat,
      ensuring it's moist and tender.
    </li>
    <li>
      After resting, unwrap the brisket. Slice against the grain, starting with
      the flat cut and moving towards the point. The slices should be about
      pencil-width thick for the perfect texture.
    </li>
    <li>
      Serve the sliced brisket as is or with your favorite barbecue sauce,
      alongside traditional sides like coleslaw, potato salad, or baked beans.
    </li>
  </ol>
